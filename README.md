# Frontend Setup

This branch contains the frontend portion of our project. The frontend is built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and managed with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Follow the steps below to install dependencies and run the app locally.

---------------------

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

You can check your versions for node and npm on the command line with:

node -v
npm -v

- Note: to download the latest version of npm, on the command line, run the following command:
npm install -g npm

----------------------

Before running the server, make sure you are in the right directory. You should be in the "frontend" directory of the project.

While you are in the "frontend" directory run "npm install" one last time to make sure you have all the dependencies.

After everything is set run "npm run dev" to start the server.

If you wish to close the server hit "control + c" on your keyboard.
